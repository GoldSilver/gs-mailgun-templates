            <p>We are sending this email to confirm that your automatic payment settings for vault storage with GoldSilver.com have been adjusted.</p>
            <ul>

                    Status:
                    \{{#if storageAutoPay.isEnabled}}
                        Auto-pay with card
                    \{{else}}
                        Charge my balance / send me a bill

            <p>You will receive an invoice every storage billing period, and your card or account balance will be automatically debited to cover the fees.</p>
            <p>If your automatic payment method fails for any reason, or you have insufficient balance, we will let you know so that you can settle manually at that time.</p>
