            <p>Weâ€™ve received your order \{{sellOrder.orderId}} to sell precious metals currently in your possession and are reviewing the details. <b>This may take up to one business day, as we determine the best location to receive your metals</b>.</p>
            <p>Once accepted, we will follow up with complete order details and instructions on where to send your metals.</p>
            <p>Until then, your price is locked.</p>
