<p>Note: quoted shipment estimates are based on product availability, as communicated to us by our wholesale supply network, at the time your order was placed.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Actual shipment times depend on availability when payment clears (inventory is not held until orders are paid in full)</span>. Post-paid orders (like wires and checks), or orders flagged for fraud investigations by our payment providers, may ship more slowly if a product becomes back-ordered during that time. Unexpected changes in supplier availability may also affect shipment times during times of high demand or limited supply.</p>
<p>Be assured that all price locks are honored even if there are shipping delays.</p>
